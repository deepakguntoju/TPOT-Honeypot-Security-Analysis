## üìä CSV Reports

### `Attacker AS_N - Top 10.csv`
Lists the top 10 autonomous systems (ASNs) from which malicious traffic originated. Useful for identifying ISP-level threat clustering and botnet infrastructure.

### `Cowrie - Top Downloads.csv`
Captured download attempts via Cowrie (SSH honeypot). Shows which malware or payloads attackers tried to fetch after initial access.

### `Password Tagcloud.csv`
A tag cloud representation of attempted passwords against the SSH honeypot. Reveals brute-force trends and common credential reuse.

### `Suricata Alert Signature - Top 10.csv`
Top 10 triggered Suricata rules (signatures), indicating the most common types of attacks detected (e.g., exploit attempts, malware beacons).

### `Suricata CVE - Top 10.csv`
Most frequently observed CVEs based on Suricata rule matches. Highlights which known vulnerabilities are being targeted in the wild.

### `Suricata Source IP - Top 10.csv`
Top 10 attacker IP addresses triggering Suricata alerts. Can be used for blacklist generation or further threat enrichment.

### `Username Tagcloud.csv`
Visualization data of attempted usernames against Cowrie. Reveals common targets like `root`, `admin`, and default system users.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots & Visualizations

### `ET MALWARE log results.png`
Snapshot of Suricata logs filtered by the "ET MALWARE" signature category. Highlights known malware communication or payload delivery patterns.

### `Elasticvue Health.png`
Screenshot from the Elasticvue interface showing Elasticsearch cluster health, document volume, and node status. Demonstrates observability and operational awareness.

### `Log analysis.png`
Dashboard or summary visualization of honeypot dataa. Useful for showcasing high-level trends in attacks, ports, and sources.
